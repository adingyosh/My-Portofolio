# My Data Science Portofolio
Portofolio is made by myself in purpose to study and self improvement. All of this project I started from courses 'Introduction Python for Data Science' by Hacktiv8. I performed this code using Python language and Jupyter Notebook.
In this project, we use mostly
* numpy for numerical and mathematical operations
* pandas DataFrame Manipulation and Handling
* matplotlib Visualizing our Data
* seaborn Visualizing data in more compact form



## [Project 1: London Crime](https://github.com/adingyosh/My-Portofolio/blob/main/Project%201.ipynb)
* This project contains the code for a general analysis of the London Crime Data 2008-2016 dataset hosted by Kaggle
* Use Python to cleaning data, explore data, and visualization
* Creating chloropeth map for crime distribution in London 

### Result
- Westminster is the most dangerous borough in London, due highest number of total crimes otherwise City of London is safest, due very low crimes
- Top 3 crime major category are theft, violence againts person and burglary
- Most popular crime minor category in violence againts person is Harrasment

## [Project 2: Bank Marketing Data Set](https://github.com/adingyosh/My-Portofolio/blob/main/Project%202.ipynb)
* The data is related with direct marketing campaigns. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be or not subscribed
* Use Python to cleaning data, explore data, and visualization
* Creating model machine learning in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank
* Train and Test accuracy for each model to determine which model have highest accuraycy ( Logistics Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM)

### Result
- Job type in common of client are blue collar, management and techinican
- Student and retired seems interested to do deposit
- Random forest has highest accuracy for model 90.4 %
- Highest feature importance for model are duration, balance and age

## [Project 3: House Price Prediction](https://github.com/adingyosh/H8ModelDeploy_PYTN052_Fadlil)

* Use Python to cleaning data, explore data, and visualization
* Creating linear Regression model to predict house price with several condition
* Model deployment using flask

## [Project:4 Loan Prediction](https://github.com/adingyosh/My-Portofolio/blob/main/Loan%20Prediction%20project.ipynb)
* Based on variety of dataset showing different kind of people with various status and likeness to return the Loan and our model understood the pattern of the Data
* Use Python to cleaning data, explore data, and visualization

#### Result
* Most important features for model is income type, education and housing type
* Bussinessman and Student have no problem with payment loan
* Higher education have better record on payment
* Client who live in their house have better record on payment than client who lived in rented apartment
* Decision Tree Has highest accuracy for Model for Target to help next lender decision
Decision Tree Has highest accuracy for Model for Target to help next lender decision
